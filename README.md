About Me:
I hold a Bachelor's degree in Game Development from Full Sail University, where I built a strong foundation in programming, design, and interactive media. I have been exploring game development as an indie developer for over three years. I've worked as a Software Engineer Consultant, contributing to client projects that required full-stack development, problem-solving, and a fast-paced, agile mindset. I completed an intensive full-stack web development bootcamp, where I deepened my skills in modern web technologies and development workflows. 
Before transitioning into tech, I served for 5 years in U.S. Army Military Intelligence â€” an experience that honed my discipline, attention to detail, and ability to thrive under pressure.
